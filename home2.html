   3)The Colonnaded Street
</ul>
<ul>
   The street represents an original Nabataean creation,later refurbished during the period of Roman occupation. It would have been one of the principal shopping streets of ancient Petra.The street was rebuilt in 106 BC with a width of 6 meters.
</ul>
<ul>
   The excavation fossil indicates that there was an older road with 1-2 floor building, lying on its side. On the left of the portico street to the south, there is a set of stairs that leads to the courtyard, which is called the market. This is believed to have been the heart of the city and center of various types of commercial activities and transactions during the third century BC. The street continued to be used throughout the Byzantine period during the fourth and fifth centuries, until the sixth. 
</ul>
<ul>
   At the end of the road lies the triple gate, which leads to the Temple of Qasr Al-Bint. The street was paved in horizontal and vertical ways in order to facilitate the movement of vehicles as it curved from the middle to allow the draining of water, which is equipped with a network of channels under the street level. The main tripartite gate led to the sacred courtyard known as the Temple of Qasr Al-Bint. Ahead of the entrance to the Gate, there lies a set of stairs that leads to the Temple, and on the other side lies the Black Winged Temple, which is dedicated to the God of Lat and Uzza, who is the mate of the major Nabataean gods.
</ul>
<ul>
   At the beginning of the colonnaded street The Nymphaeum will be at the right side, which is a semi-circular public fountain near the junction of Wadi Musa and Wadi al-Mataha. six Nabataean columns decorated the facade, It received water from a tank on the opposite side of the valley. Now it is shaded by a juniper tree that is 450 years old.

      4)The Red Sea 
   </ul>
   <ul>
      The Red Sea (Arabic: البحر الأحمر - بحر القلزم) is a seawater inlet of the Indian Ocean, lying between Africa and Asia. Its connection to the ocean is in the south, through the Bab el Mandeb strait and the Gulf of Aden. To its north lie the Sinai Peninsula, the Gulf of Aqaba, and the Gulf of Suez (leading to the Suez Canal). It is underlain by the Red Sea Rift, which is part of the Great Rift Valley.
   </ul>
   <ul>
      Approximately 40% of the Red Sea is quite shallow (less than 100 m (330 ft) deep), and about 25% is less than 50 m (164 ft) deep. The extensive shallow shelves are noted for their marine life and corals. More than 1,000 invertebrate species and 200 types of soft and hard coral live in the sea. The Red Sea is the world's northernmost tropical sea, and has been designated a Global 200 ecoregion.

5)The Dead Sea
   </ul>
   <ul>
      The Dead Sea (Arabic: اَلْبَحْرُ الْمَيْتُ), also known by other names, is a salt lake bordered by Jordan to the east and the West Bank and Israel to the west. It lies in the Jordan Rift Valley, and its main tributary is the Jordan River.
   </ul>
   <ul>
      The Dead Sea has attracted visitors from around the Mediterranean Basin for thousands of years. It was one of the world's first health resorts (for Herod the Great), and it has been the supplier of a wide variety of products, from asphalt for Egyptian mummification to potash for fertilisers. Today, tourists visit the sea on its Israeli, Jordanian and West Bank coastlines. The Palestinian tourism industry has been met with setbacks in developing along the West Bank coast due to the Israeli occupation.[citation needed]
